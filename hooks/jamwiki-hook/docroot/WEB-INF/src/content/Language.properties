import-wiki-images-help=Submit a ZIP file of the images to import. You can zip the images folder of MediaWiki directly (sometimes it's called "upload"). If you do so, it's recommended to remove the directories called "archive", "temp" and "thumbs" to reduce the ZIP size since they will be ignored.
import-wiki-pages-help=Submit an XML file exported by MediaWiki through the "Special:Export" page (see "Special pages" in the toolbox menu).
import-wiki-strict-mode-help=Remove every unrecognizable MediaWiki markup from the imported page.
import-wiki-users-help=Submit a CSV file with the email addresses of the users to match with those in the portal. The file should have two columns: the user name and the email address. This file can be obtained using SQL directly from MediaWiki's database.
